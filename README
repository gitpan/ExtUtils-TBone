NAME
    ExtUtils::TBone - a "skeleton" for writing "t/*.t" test files.

SYNOPSIS
    Include a copy of this module in your t directory (as
    t/ExtUtils/TBone.pm), and then write your t/*.t files like this:

        use lib "./t";             # to pick up a ExtUtils::TBone
        use ExtUtils::TBone;

        # Make a tester... here are 3 different alternatives:
        my $T = typical ExtUtils::TBone;                 # standard log
        my $T = new ExtUtils::TBone;                     # no log 
        my $T = new ExtUtils::TBone "testout/Foo.tlog";  # explicit log
        
        # Begin testing, and expect 3 tests in all:
        $T->begin(3);                           # expect 3 tests
        $T->msg("Something for the log file");  # message for the log
        
        # Run some tests:    
        $T->ok($this);                  # test 1: no real info logged
        $T->ok($that,                   # test 2: logs a comment
               "Is that ok, or isn't it?"); 
        $T->ok(($this eq $that),        # test 3: logs comment + vars 
               "Do they match?",
               This => $this,
               That => $that);
         
        # That last one could have also been written... 
        $T->ok_eq($this, $that);            # does 'eq' and logs operands
        $T->ok_eqnum($this, $that);         # does '==' and logs operands 
         
        # End testing:
        $T->end;   

DESCRIPTION
    This module is intended for folks who release CPAN modules with "t/*.t"
    tests. It makes it easy for you to output syntactically correct test-
    output while at the same time logging all test activity to a log file.
    Hopefully, bug reports which include the contents of this file will be
    easier for you to investigate.
